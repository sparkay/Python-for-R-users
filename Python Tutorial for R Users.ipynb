    "# Introduction\n",
    "This is a Python tutorial for established R data analysts. If you are already comfortable with Data Analysis/Science in R, and want to add Python to your toolbox, it can be difficult to find a tutorial that will get you started quickly and efficiently. Most tutorials out there either assume you have very limited programming experience or are oriented toward established programmers but include far more than you need to know to get started on a data anlaysis problem. Folks who have been doing analysis in R for years probably don't need to spend 30 minutes on basic data types and loop structures. They just need to know Python's specific syntax and quirks. Data scientists also probably don't (initially) need to know all the ins and outs of writing an X, Y, or Z in Python. They just want to know how to read a file into the pandas data format and where to find a good regression (or ML or clustering etc.) library.\n",

    "This author is releatively new to Python. There are likely better ways to do some of the things I will show you. I will be updating this tutorial as I learn more myself."

    "When you are setting up a new machine for analysis in R, you typically download and install the R kernel, RStudio, and then install a slew of common packages from CRAN. For Python, just download and install Anaconda. this will give you the Python interpreter, the Jupyter notebook interface, and a very long list of analysis libraries. Here's a quick recap:\n",

    "In addition to your usual primatives (int, float, str, bool), Python uses lists and the related dicts. Lists and dicts are somewhat like lists and dataframes in R. The pandas library in Python, which borrows many concepts from dplyr, makes the comparison even closer.\n",

    "The distincting between referencing a list and assigning a new list is perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when using Python to analyze data. Unlike R, which creates a new copy of your variable almost everytime you operate on that variable [link to advanced R explanation], Python defaults to pointing to the location of a list variable in memory and only operating on that one copy. This is far more efficient in terms of memory usage, but can lead to unexpected results. \n",
